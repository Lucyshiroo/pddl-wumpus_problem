Emergency Response Project
This project implements an emergency response system using a planning domain-specific language (PDDL). The system simulates the dispatching of emergency vehicles (fire truck, police truck, and ambulance) to various locations based on a given plan.

Code Description
The code consists of the following functions:

send_fire_truck()
Simulates sending a fire truck to the station with fire.

send_police_truck()
Simulates sending a police truck to the station with police.

send_ambulance()
Simulates sending an ambulance to the station with an ambulance.

execute_actions(actions)
Executes a list of actions in Python. It interacts with the emergency services, updates the state, and performs necessary actions based on the input plan.

generate_pddl_files()
Generates the PDDL domain and problem files. The domain file defines the types, predicates, and actions involved in the emergency response system. The problem file defines the objects, initial state, and goal state.

execute_pddl_solver()
Executes the PDDL solver using the subprocess module. It redirects the output to a file (plan.txt) that contains a sample plan for demonstration purposes.

parse_plan()
Parses the plan from the output file (plan.txt) and extracts the actions.

solve_emergency_response()
Coordinates the entire process by generating PDDL files, executing the PDDL solver, parsing the plan, and executing the actions.

Execution Instructions
To execute the code, follow these steps:

Install the necessary dependencies if required (e.g., PDDL solver).

Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.

Navigate to the project directory.

Make sure the subprocess module is available in your Python environment.

Run the following command:

shell
Copy code
python emergency_response.py
This will execute the solve_emergency_response() function, which generates the PDDL files, solves the emergency response problem, and executes the actions based on the generated plan.

Monitor the output to observe the simulated emergency response actions.

Additional Notes
The current implementation includes a sample plan file (plan.txt) instead of executing an actual PDDL solver. Modify the execute_pddl_solver() function to integrate an actual PDDL solver and update the parse_plan() function accordingly if desired.

Customize the domain and problem descriptions in the generate_pddl_files() function to suit your specific emergency response scenario.

Extend the code by adding new actions, modifying the domain, or expanding the functionality as needed. Ensure to update the PDDL files accordingly.

Include additional instructions, installation requirements, or dependencies in the README file if necessary.
